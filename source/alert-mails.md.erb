You may have noticed that there is an "Alert Mail" configuration section when you add or edit an endpoint in the admin interface.

We have plans to open-source our Alert Mailer, which takes advantage of this data to send you e-mails when errors on your registered endpoints have crossed your configured thresholds.

Keep an eye on this page for further updates and details on this feature.
